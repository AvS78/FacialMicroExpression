Spontaneous Facial Micro- Expression Classification. Micro-Expressions, Lie Detection, Review of Surveys, Feature extraction, HOF, LBPTOP, Facial Features, Automated feature extraction, CASMEII

# Context: 
Automated and reliable identification of Facial micro-expressions. Correct micro- expressions identification has several industrial uses. Todayâ€™s manual approaches have low accuracy

# Aims: 
Survey previous works for automated /machine learning driven facial micro-expression detection. Identify a novel alternate approach to improve Facial micro-expression detection

# Methods: 
Histogram of oriented optical flow (HOOF) and Local binary Pattern - Three orthogonal Planes (LBP-TOP) for feature extraction, Feed Forward Neural Network FFNN based Multi-Class Classifier. , Chinese Academy of Sciences Micro Simultaneous Expression CAMSEII for spontaneous micro-expression database to train, Metrics for Accuracy, Recall in an unbalanced dataset

# Baseline Model: 
Spontaneous Facial Micro-Expression Recognition using 3D Spatiotemporal Convolutional Neural Networks
# Results: 
In a Leave one Video Out cross validation (LOVOCV), we achieved an weighted average f1-score of 81%, precision (86%), recall (80%). The best accuracy was achieved with aa features and bb depth cc parameter FF NN. Feature extraction and modelling was done on Nvidia RTX2070 and Nvidia GTX1080 based GPU computers.
# Conclusions: 
We achieved satisfactory results vs the baseline. Dataset augmentation is most important activity for building Automated Spontaneous Micro-Expression detection based industrial application. Dataset augmentations requires govt authorities and research institution collaboration for an ethnically and culturally rich high quality (fps, resolution) dataset.
